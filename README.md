## Instructions

A general description of the BigLab 2 is avaible in the `course-materials` repository, [under _labs_](https://polito-wa1-aw1-2022.github.io/materials/labs/BigLab2/BigLab2.pdf). In the same repository, you can find the [instructions for GitHub Classroom](https://polito-wa1-aw1-2022.github.io/materials/labs/GH-Classroom-BigLab-Instructions.pdf), covering BigLabs and exam sessions.

Once you cloned this repository, please write the group name and names of the members of the group in the above section.

In the `client` directory, do **NOT** create a new folder for the project, i.e., `client` should directly contain the `public` and `src` folders and the `package.json` files coming from BigLab1.

When committing on this repository, please, do **NOT** commit the `node_modules` directory, so that it is not pushed to GitHub.
This should be already automatically excluded from the `.gitignore` file, but double-check.

When another member of the team pulls the updated project from the repository, remember to run `npm install` in the project directory to recreate all the Node.js dependencies locally, in the `node_modules` folder.
Remember that `npm install` should be executed inside the `client` and `server` folders (not in the `BigLab2` root directory).

Finally, remember to add the `final` tag for the final submission, otherwise it will not be graded.
